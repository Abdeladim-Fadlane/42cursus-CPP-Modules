We Have a unsorted vector (or any container) :

<p align="center">

<p align="center">

We create a vector of pairs of unsigned integers (because the value to be inserted are positives) 

<p align="center">

<p align="center">

Then we take a vector of pairs of unsigned integers and swaps the first and second elements if the first element is greater than the second element

<p align="center">

<p align="center">

After that we take a vector of pairs of unsigned integers and extracts the second element of each pair into a new vector called the largest and the first element of each pair into a new vector called smallest.

<p align="center">

Itâ€™s up to you to choose which one to sort, i choose the largest and
you need to sort them use Recursively sort 

<p align="center">

Now start to insert the elements of largest to smallest by using lower_bound to get its position and the member function insert to insert.
